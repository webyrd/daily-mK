messing with quines and self-reps these days

http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm

http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html

debug `q-error.scm` in `faster-miniKanren`

goal is to experiment with Kimian self-reps: http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/self_kim.txt:

"Kimian self-rep, like quines, got it's name from Godel Escher Bach.  A
Kimian 'program' is actually the error produced by the system when it
encounters the code.  Kimian self reps are therefore very system-specific,
and even implementation specific."


After a helpful discussion with Greg Rosenblatt, I agree that adding lambda and quote to the initial env could make the code cleaner.  Also, consider combining some of the code for app and prim-app, to simplify code and remove duplicate error messages.

Also need to make sure that the standard Quine is compatible with the new interp, and try to reorder the clauses/simplify so that I can generate the standard Quine.

And make sure duplicate errors are no longer produced.
