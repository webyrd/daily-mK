(contining from Sun Jan 19)

messing with quines and self-reps these days

http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm

http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html

debug `q-error.scm` in `faster-miniKanren`

goal is to experiment with Kimian self-reps: http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/self_kim.txt:

"Kimian self-rep, like quines, got it's name from Godel Escher Bach.  A
Kimian 'program' is actually the error produced by the system when it
encounters the code.  Kimian self reps are therefore very system-specific,
and even implementation specific."


I want to add error handling to the interp so I can generate an input expression that is the same as the error produced


Hmm--our situation has not improved...

> (run* (q) (evalo '(quote cat) q))
((value cat)
  (error (unbound-variable quote))
  (error (unbound-variable quote)))
