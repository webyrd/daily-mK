(contining from Mon Jan 20)

messing with quines and self-reps these days

http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm

http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html

debug `q-error.scm` in `faster-miniKanren`

goal is to experiment with Kimian self-reps: http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/self_kim.txt:

"Kimian self-rep, like quines, got it's name from Godel Escher Bach.  A
Kimian 'program' is actually the error produced by the system when it
encounters the code.  Kimian self reps are therefore very system-specific,
and even implementation specific."


Seem to have fixed the problem with (quote cat) resulting in quote being unbound, although solution isn't elegant.

We seem to have a Kimian self-rep!

> (run 2 (q) (evalo q q))
((error (unbound-variable error))
  (error (unbound-variable error)))

Alas, run 3 seems to diverge or just take a super long time
